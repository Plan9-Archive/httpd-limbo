# testing/todo

todo:
- more testing

- do hostname lookups for config "listen"?  instead of just ips
- support transfer-encoding chunked and compressed content-encodings from client?
- check for security issues with http
- check spec which error responses must be with/without body
- transparent compression?
- connection rate limiting?
- think of ssl?
- try to fix dir listings for paths with multiple slashes in them.  firefox breaks on them, is firefox right?
- test with other browsers
