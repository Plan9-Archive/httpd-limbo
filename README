httpd is a simple httpd.

features:
- http/1.0, http/1.1 (keep-alive, chunked responses).  no "http/0.9".
- cgi and scgi support
- virtual hosts
- determining content-type based on file extension
- error/access logging
- index file serving, html directory listings
- http basic authentication
- "range" requests, for random access to files
- redirections with regular expressions

testing:
- better configurability/syntax for doing redirect/scgi/auth/others based on hostname/port?
	- aliases for host/port configs
	- verify local ip is in allowed list for request
	- if no listen ips have been specified, allow on all.  if any has been specified, enforce.
	- use host:port for vhost dirs
	- config reloading.  on explicit request only?  over file2chan thing
	- make sure command-line options make sense now (work)
	- do all changeable config options work after reload?
- redirects based on path rewriting?
- accesslog optional
- find rfc that handles ip6 addresses in host-header, and understand them with port

todo:
- better messages in errorlog
- write events to error log:  started, reloaded
- read through code and mention important semantics in manual page
- for some errors, e.g. "range not satisfiable", we must not set the etag?

- do hostname lookups for config "listen"?  instead of just ips
- support transfer-encoding chunked and compressed content-encodings from client?
- check for security issues with http
- check spec which error responses must be with/without body
- transparent compression?
- connection rate limiting?
- think of ssl?
- try to fix dir listings for paths with multiple slashes in them.  firefox breaks on them, is firefox right?
- test with other browsers
- try to break it
- test cases?  automatic testing can probably be done.

- write a doc about http protocol
	* perhaps with an overview of headers that must be implemented for a minimal webserver
	* which headers are safe to ignore
	* which parts of the spec aren't used much
	* which parts of the spec are abused/misused
	* which "extensions" are encountered in the wild
	* where the spec isn't complete or contradicts itself
	* which headers are for clients/proxies/servers only.
	* which response codes return an entity body
	* common client requests
	* common server responses

install

to install this software, make sure there is a mkconfig file in
this directory.  you can symlink/bind the one from your inferno
installation.  next, type "mk install".  httpd depends on package
"http", the http library, published using mercurial:  hg clone
static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/http/.

latest version

this code is kept up to date using mercurial, to get a fresh copy:

	hg clone static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/httpd/
