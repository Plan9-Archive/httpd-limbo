httpd is a simple httpd.

features:
- http/1.0, http/1.1 (keep-alive, chunked responses).  no "http/0.9".
- scgi support
- virtual hosts
- determining content-type based on file extension
- error/access logging
- index file serving, html directory listings
- http basic authentication
- redirections

todo:
- ignore some http/1.1 headers for http/1.0 requests?  e.g. range, many more
- scgid timeouts
- better configurability/syntax for doing redirect/scgi/auth/others based on hostname/port?
- normal cgi?
- scgi response should be done non-chunked if it sets its content-length, to allow client (and server?) to detect if it closes prematurely.
- make error messages more useful, most current http daemons just say "bad request" without any other info.
- http/1.0 specifics
	* date-header allows three formats
	* missing length for clients sending a body must result in 400, not 411? (rfcrfc1945#7.2.2)
	* if-modified-since should be ignored for head request (rfc1945#8.1)

- support transfer-encoding chunked and compressed content-encodings from client?
- check for security issues with http
- check spec which error responses must be with/without body
- ndb file for config?  can be used to select host, port, path.  perhaps even header
- make faster, prespawn procs?  do less pctl stuff to not need a spawn?!
- transparent compression?
- connection rate limiting?
- redirects based on path rewriting?
- think of ssl?
- try to fix dir listings for paths with multiple slashes in them.  firefox breaks on them, is firefox right?
- test with other browsers
- try to break it
- test cases?  automatic testing can probably be done.

- write a doc about http protocol
	* perhaps with an overview of headers that must be implemented for a minimal webserver
	* which headers are safe to ignore
	* which parts of the spec aren't used much
	* which parts of the spec are abused/misused
	* which "extensions" are encountered in the wild
	* where the spec isn't complete or contradicts itself
	* which headers are for clients/proxies/servers only.
	* which response codes return an entity body
	* common client requests
	* common server responses

install

to install this software, make sure there is a mkconfig file in
this directory.  you can symlink/bind the one from your inferno
installation.  next, type "mk install".  httpd depends on package
"http", the http library, published using mercurial:  hg clone
static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/http/.

latest version

this code is kept up to date using mercurial, to get a fresh copy:

	hg clone static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/httpd/
