# install

to install this software, make sure there is a mkconfig file in
this directory.  you can symlink/bind the one from your inferno
installation.  next, type "mk install".  httpd depends on package
"http", the http library, published using mercurial.  get it from
http://www.ueber.net/code/r/http.


# download

see http://www.ueber.net/code/r/httpd for instructions.


# licence

in the public domain.  for bugs, questions, comments, etc., contact
me at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# non-features

some features will not be implemented.  for example:

- connection rate limiting.  should be done at a higher level, e.g. firewall.

# testing/todo

doc/testing.txt can be used for testing.  it has to be done manually,
enough corner cases have not been tested, but quite a few have.

todo:

- when responding with chunked data, can we embed an error message in a chunks comment-part when an error with reading the data occurs?
- support transfer-encoding chunked and compressed content-encodings from client?
- check for security issues with http
- transparent compression?
- think of ssl?
- try to fix dir listings for paths with multiple slashes in them.  firefox breaks on them, is firefox right?
- test with other browsers
