	hg clone static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/http/

# testing/todo

doc/testing.txt can be used for testing.  it has to be done manually,
enough corner cases have not been tested, but quite a few have.

todo:
- allow specifying which http methods are allowed on (s)cgi paths?
- support transfer-encoding chunked and compressed content-encodings from client?
- check for security issues with http
- transparent compression?
- connection rate limiting?
- think of ssl?
- try to fix dir listings for paths with multiple slashes in them.  firefox breaks on them, is firefox right?
- test with other browsers
