httpd is a simple httpd.

features:
- http/1.0, http/1.1 (keep-alive, chunked responses).  no "http/0.9".
- scgi support
- virtual hosts
- determining content-type based on file extension
- error/access logging
- index file serving, html directory listings
- http basic authentication
- redirections

todo:
- scgid timeouts, better scgid sanity checking
- normal cgi?
- disallow authentication for paths that don't accept it
- better configurability/syntax for doing redirect/scgi/auth/others based on hostname/port?

- support transfer-encoding chunked and compressed content-encodings from client?
- check for security issues with http
- check spec which error responses must be with/without body
- ndb file for config?  can be used to select host, port, path.  perhaps even header
- make faster, prespawn procs?  do less pctl stuff to not need a spawn?!
- transparent compression?
- connection rate limiting?
- redirects based on path rewriting?
- think of ssl?
- try to fix dir listings for paths with multiple slashes in them.  firefox breaks on them, is firefox right?
- test with other browsers
- try to break it
- test cases?  automatic testing can probably be done.

- write a doc about http protocol
	* perhaps with an overview of headers that must be implemented for a minimal webserver
	* which headers are safe to ignore
	* which parts of the spec aren't used much
	* which parts of the spec are abused/misused
	* which "extensions" are encountered in the wild
	* where the spec isn't complete or contradicts itself
	* which headers are for clients/proxies/servers only.
	* which response codes return an entity body
	* common client requests
	* common server responses

"http", the http library, published using mercurial:  hg clone
static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/http/.
