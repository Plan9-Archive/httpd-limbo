httpd is a simple httpd.

features:
- http/1.0, http/1.1
- scgi support
- virtual hosts
- sending content-type based on file extension
- error/access logging
- html directory listings

todo:
- don't use chunked for plain file or dir listing, use content-length instead.  set content-length for head as well.  should scgi response be done non-chunked if it sets its content-length?
- headers: expect, accept-*, content-range, e-tag, conditionals, many more
- timeouts on keep-alive connections

- what to do for "complex" requests on (s)cgi, such as with range header
- transparent compression?
- connection rate limiting?
- redirects?  rewrites?
- auth?
- normal cgi?
- try to fix dir listings for paths with multiple slashes in them.  firefox breaks on them, is firefox right?
- test with other browsers
